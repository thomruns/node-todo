# ToDo App 

A simple to-do list app based on a Udemy nodejs course by Anthony Alicea. The requirements of this app are as follows:

  * A user can add, edit, and delete simple one-line 'todos'
  * Each todo can be marked as complete
  * Each todo can have one optional file attachment
  * One user cannot access the todos of other users

This app uses the full MEAN stack in its development. The MongoDB sample database is hosted on mLab. Access to that db is not available within this repository, but rather only on the local development machine.

## Directory Module structure

**controllers** contains the basic api functionality of the app

**models** contains the JSON data schema
